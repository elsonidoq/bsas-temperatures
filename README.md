Should I buy an air conditioner?

So, I have a 2 year old son and summer is comming. I wouldn't really buy myself an AC, I can leave without it, but I wouldn't like my toddler having trouble to sleep because of the hot days.

This is what a data scientist should do:
* Get some data
* Visualize it
* Make an informed decision

This repo is my 2 hours attempt to do so.

To run the repo you'll need: 
* pandas
* [Fito](https://bitbucket.org/elsonidoq/fito)(yeah, I sould migrate it to github and document it a lil bit)
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook
* Mongodb (to store the temperatures)
* Rabbitmq (to parallelize scrapping)
